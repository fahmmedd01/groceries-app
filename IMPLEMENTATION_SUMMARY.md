## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

I have successfully implemented the **simplified grocery list manager** according to your specifications. The application has been completely refactored from a price-comparison shopping assistant to a simple, user-friendly grocery list manager.

## üéâ What's New

### 1. **Simplified Authentication (localStorage)**
- **Login page** with name + email only (no password required)
- "Continue as Guest" option for anonymous usage
- User data stored in browser's localStorage
- Simple sign in/sign out flow

### 2. **Main Features**
- **Voice or Text Input**: Add items using voice commands (Web Speech API) or text entry
- **AI Parsing**: Anthropic Claude extracts items, quantities, brands, and sizes from natural language
- **Retailer Selection**: Assign items to specific retailers (Walmart, Walgreens, Mariano's, Costco, Sam's Club, or custom "Other")
- **Shopping Lists**: Keep a running list under each retailer
- **Purchase Tracking**: Check off items as you purchase them

### 3. **Dashboard**
- View all your grocery lists (active and archived)
- See progress: X of Y items purchased
- Create, view, edit, delete, or archive lists
- Filter between active lists and all lists

### 4. **Stores Management**
- Add your favorite stores with:
  - Store name (e.g., "Walmart Supercenter")
  - Retailer type
  - Address (text only, no maps)
- Manage stores (add, view, delete)

### 5. **Settings**
- Edit your profile (name, email)
- Export all lists as JSON for backup
- Clear all data option

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. **Update Supabase Database**

Run the updated SQL schema in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# File: supabase-schema.sql
```

This will:
- Create new `stores` and `shopping_sessions` tables
- Add migration to update existing tables
- Update RLS policies for simplified auth

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Your existing `.env.local` should work as-is:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Anthropic AI (for parsing grocery lists)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd /Users/farazahmed/Documents/Groceries-app
npm install
```

### 4. **Run Locally**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 5. **Deploy to Vercel**

Your Vercel deployment should automatically trigger from the GitHub push. Make sure your environment variables are set in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add all variables from your `.env.local`

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**If build fails**:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**If Supabase errors**:
- Verify all tables exist in Supabase
